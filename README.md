# Iris Dataset Classification using Spark Machine Learning Library

This assignment will use Spark MLlib to perform classification on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is accessed from the R environment or through url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data.

The classification process will involve the following steps:

+ Loading the Iris dataset into Spark DataFrame
+ Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
+ Selecting a classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest and Logistic Regression from Spark MLlib.
+ Employing a techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to fine tune the hyperparameters of the chosen algorithms.
+ Evaluating the performance of the tuned model using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recll and F1-score.
+ Using the tuned model to generate predictions on the testing data.
+ Conducting a comparative analysis between the predicted labels and actual labels to assess the model's performance.
